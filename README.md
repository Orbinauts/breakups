# @orbinauts/breakups

On-orbit breakup detection from public orbital-element histories, in TypeScript, scored against every reported fragmentation since 2005.

The detector behind [Orbinauts](https://orbinauts.com), the live satellite map.

A satellite, a rocket body or a piece of debris that breaks up in orbit leaves two traces in public data: its own orbit jumps, by metres to kilometres, in the element sets the catalogue publishes for it; and days to weeks later new objects appear under its launch. This library reads the first trace to raise an alert before the second is published, and uses the second to confirm it. Every alert carries the numbers it was judged by.

The library is not written yet. What this repository holds today is the ground it will be measured on: the **ground truth**, one row per breakup an authority reported since 1961, built from its sources by a script and checked by the tests, and the types to read it.

- Ground truth: every reported breakup and anomalous event, with each source's statement verbatim, the resolved time, orbit, cause and piece count, which source each came from, and every disagreement between sources.
- Next: the Archive of element histories the detector is backtested over, the scorecard that computes the KPIs, and the detector itself.

## Install

```sh
npm install @orbinauts/breakups
```

The package is ESM only, ships TypeScript declarations and source maps, and depends on `@orbinauts/engine`.

## Quick start

Read the ground truth and print the three most recent events it carries:

```js
import { readBreakups, yearOf } from "@orbinauts/breakups";
import file from "@orbinauts/breakups/breakups.json" with { type: "json" };

// Every row checked: a malformed row throws, naming it.
const breakups = readBreakups(file);

// The events the scorecard counts: breakups and anomalous events of a catalogued object, since 2005.
const scoreable = breakups.filter((breakup) => breakup.scoreable && yearOf(breakup) >= 2005);

for (const breakup of scoreable.slice(-3)) {
  const when = breakup.event.at ?? `by ${breakup.event.to}`;
  console.log(`${when} ${breakup.parent.name} (${breakup.parent.catalogueNumber}), ${breakup.kind}, confidence ${breakup.confidence}, ${breakup.orbit.regime}`);
}
```

It prints:

```text
by 2026-09-04T00:00Z Yaogan-50 02 (68196), breakup, confidence D, LEO
2026-09-13T21:13Z USA 32 (19460), breakup, confidence A, LEO
2026-10-05T09:45Z Meteor 2-7 (second event) (12456), breakup, confidence C, LEO
```

## How well it does

There is no detector yet, so there is no score. When there is one, this section will carry the scorecard's table: of the reported events since 2005, how many the parent's own orbit flagged before the fragments' element data was published, how many were flagged late, how many were missed, and how many alerts matched no reported event, on years held out from the ones the thresholds were fitted on. The targets are nine in ten detected and fewer than one false alarm in ten.

## Ground truth

A positive event is a breakup that was reported, so we are sure it happened: by NASA, by ESA, by U.S. Space Forces-Space, by a named analyst, or by the public catalogue itself listing a burst of new debris under the parent's launch (at least five objects within thirty days, more than ninety days after the launch, and at least a fifth of the debris the launch already had). `data/breakups.json` holds every one found, 1961 to today, each with the statements of every source that reported it and the values resolved from them. The scorecard runs over the events from 2005, where the yearly element bundles begin, and scores NASA's two kinds apart: the detection target is for breakups, the destructive kind; anomalous events, where a body sheds a piece or two at low speed and stays intact, barely move the parent and are reported on a second line. Events whose parent has no public element sets at all are listed apart and left out of the denominator, and the headline is over events reported to the day or better.

| Events from 2005 | Count |
| --- | --- |
| All | 246 |
| Scoreable (breakups and anomalous events of a catalogued object) | 175 |
| Breakups | 188 |
| Anomalous events (low-velocity shedding) | 28 |
| Aerodynamic breakups at reentry (kept out) | 23 |
| Objects released on purpose (kept out) | 2 |
| Reports naming no object (kept out) | 5 |
| Confidence A (an authority states the minute) | 74 |
| Confidence B (an authority states the day, or a window of three days at most) | 31 |
| Confidence C (GCAT alone, an authority's month, or an analyst's dating) | 43 |
| Confidence D (pieces in the catalogue, or news with no time) | 27 |

The sources, and what each gives:

- **NASA, History of On-Orbit Satellite Fragmentations, 16th edition** (NASA/TP-20220019160, December 2022): every breakup and anomalous event to 1 May 2022, each with its date, time, altitude, assessed cause and the parent's pre-event element set. Read from the text of the PDF.
- **NASA, Orbital Debris Quarterly News**: each breakup since the cut-off, in prose. Typed by hand with issue and page.
- **GCAT, Space Debris Clouds** (Jonathan McDowell, planet4589.org, CC-BY-4.0): 402 debris clouds with the parent, the event date and the orbit. Read from its table.
- **ESA, Space Environment Report 2025**, Table 3.7: the fragmentations of 2024, the object unnamed.
- **U.S. Space Forces-Space notices**, named analysts, LeoLabs' notifications and news reports for 2025 to 2026, and the public catalogue where fragments were published with no report.

Where sources disagree, the time comes from the source that states it most finely, an authority first; the orbit from NASA's spread, then the quarterly news, then GCAT; the cause from NASA, then ESA, then GCAT; the piece count from the latest statement. Every disagreement is kept on the row. A reviewer who disagrees with a row edits the hand file or the overrides, never the built file; `npm run truth` rebuilds it and the tests fail until the committed file matches. [docs/truth.md](docs/truth.md) lists what was built from what.

## The Archive

The detector is backtested over the Archive: every catalogued object's element sets from 2005 to today, stripped to the fields the detector reads (the six mean elements, the drag terms, the element set number, the publication order) and stored one year at a time as compressed columns beside a table of the objects, joined to a snapshot of the satellite catalogue (CelesTrak) and to the space-weather indices of each day (GFZ Potsdam's Kp, ap and F10.7, CC BY 4.0; NASA OMNI2's Dst). It is built on a maintainer's machine from the public catalogue's yearly bundles of two-line sets and from its history class for the current year, by the scripts under `scripts/archive/`, and published as assets of this repository's `archive-v1` release with a manifest of hashes; `npm run archive:download -- 2024 2025` fetches years into `../breakups-archive`, verifying each. Neither the bundles nor the Archive are ever committed. [docs/decisions/0003](docs/decisions/0003-the-archive-is-a-release-asset-never-in-git.md) says why.

## Runtimes

- **Node** 22 or later. CI runs on Node 22 and 24.
- **Browsers**, through a bundler: the library is ES2022 modules and imports no Node built-in, a rule its own tests enforce.
- **Cloudflare Workers**: nothing to configure.
